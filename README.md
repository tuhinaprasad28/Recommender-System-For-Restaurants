# Recommender-System-For-Restaurants
Problem statement:
How can we use the knowledge of the crowd
and apply machine learning algorithms to
recommend the best restaurants to the
customers of the food application.
We are creating a restaurant recommender,
which can give a user an option that now
stands out, so that the user will not receive
the same recommendation in case a previous
choice was unappealing.
